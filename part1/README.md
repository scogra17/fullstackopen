# About
Notes for part 1 of the course

# Notes
## Using `create-react-app`
* `$ npx create-react-app [app-name]`

## Differences between HTML and JSX
* All tags in JSX must be closed (e.g. <br /> rather than HTML's <br>)

## Passing data to components
* Data is passed as a prop object

## Misc
* A component should return either a single root node or an array. The root node, however, can be an empty tag ("fragment") to prevent too many divs from being in the markup
* A component name must be capitalized
